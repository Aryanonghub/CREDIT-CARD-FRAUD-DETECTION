# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This repository contains a project aimed at detecting credit card fraud using a machine learning model. The model employs Logistic Regression to classify transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate based on a dataset of credit card transactions.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to develop a robust model for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. Given the sensitive nature of financial transactions, accurately identifying fraud while minimizing false positives is critical. This project utilizes Logistic Regression for classification.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of anonymized credit card transaction data. Each record has been labeled as either fraudulent or legitimate. The features in the dataset are scaled and anonymized to preserve confidentiality.

## Features

- **V1, V2, ... V28**: The result of a PCA transformation. Due to confidentiality issues, the original features are not provided, and these variables represent the principal components.
- **Time**: Number of seconds elapsed between this transaction and the first transaction in the dataset.
- **Amount**: Transaction amount.
- **Class**: Target variable where 1 indicates fraud and 0 indicates legitimate.

## Modeling

The primary model used in this project is **Logistic Regression**, which is suitable for binary classification tasks. Logistic Regression is particularly chosen for its interpretability and efficiency on large datasets. The model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with a focus on optimizing recall to minimize false negatives.

## Results

Results will be discussed in terms of:
- **Accuracy**: The overall correctness of the model.
- **Precision**: The rate of correct positive predictions.
- **Recall**: The rate at which actual fraudulent cases are identified.
- **F1-Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing the two metrics.
